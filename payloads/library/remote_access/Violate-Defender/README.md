# Violate-Defender

### FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY ####  
This is a simple DuckyScript that has been tested on the O.MG cable. it is designed to create a rule expection to a folder usering powershell to circumvent Windows Defender. this may only work if the user/target in quesiton has elevated rights to run a cmd/powershell prompt as Administrator. the script will use the curl command and download a file from your attacker machine and place it into a  created folder of your choice while applying the execption to that folder.
